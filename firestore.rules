/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Nexus Student Marketplace.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and listings,
 * ensuring that only authenticated users can create, modify, or delete their own data.
 * It leverages denormalization to avoid costly `get()` calls and maintains
 * authorization independence by embedding ownership information directly within documents.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Stores user profiles, with `userId` matching the authenticated user's UID.
 * - `/listings/{listingId}`: Stores listings, with each listing containing a `sellerId` field
 *   to indicate the owner.
 * - `/transactions/{transactionId}`: Stores transaction data.
 * - `/reviews/{reviewId}`: Stores reviews associated with listings.
 * - `/messages/{messageId}`: Stores individual chat messages.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles are strictly controlled: only the authenticated user can read/write their own profile.
 * - Listings have public read access, but write access is restricted to the owner (seller).
 * - `list` operation is denied on `/users` collection.
 * - Transactions, reviews, and messages are not secured beyond basic existence checks for prototyping.
