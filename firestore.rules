/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Nexus Student Marketplace.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and restricts write access to prevent unauthorized data modification.
 * It allows public read access to listings and reviews to foster transparency and discovery while ensuring only the owners can modify them.
 * Transactions and messages are open for prototyping purposes.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data. Each user can only read and write their own profile.
 * - /listings/{listingId}: Stores listing data. Anyone can read listings, but only the seller can create, update, or delete their listings.
 * - /transactions/{transactionId}: Stores transaction data. Open access for prototyping.
 * - /reviews/{reviewId}: Stores review data. Open access for prototyping.
 * - /messages/{messageId}: Stores message data. Open access for prototyping.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Role-based access control is not implemented in this version.
 * - Public read access is granted to listings and reviews to encourage marketplace activity.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Listings store the sellerId directly within the document to avoid costly `get()` calls to the user's profile when enforcing ownership.
