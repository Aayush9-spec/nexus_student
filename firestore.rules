/**
 * @fileOverview
 * This ruleset enforces a strict, role-based access control model for the Nexus 2.0 student marketplace.
 * It prioritizes verified users and owner-only write access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, accessible only by the user themselves.
 * - /listings/{listingId}: Stores marketplace listings, with owner-only modification rights and public read access.
 * - /chats/{chatId}: Stores chat metadata, with access restricted to chat participants.
 * - /chats/{chatId}/messages/{messageId}: Stores messages within a chat, with access restricted to chat participants.
 * - /reviews/{reviewId}: Stores reviews, with no specific write restrictions beyond existence.
 * - /events/{eventId}: Stores events, with owner-only modification rights.
 * - /community_feed/{postId}: Stores community feed posts, with owner-only modification rights and public read access.
 * - /reports/{reportId}: Stores reports, with no specific write restrictions beyond existence.
 * - /transactions/{transactionId}: Stores transaction data, with no specific write restrictions beyond existence.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Stores admin roles. The existence of a document grants admin privileges.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Read-only collections have `allow get, list: if true;`.
 * - The default security posture for ambiguous relationships is strict owner-only access.
 * - Relational integrity is maintained by validating `creatorId` on create and enforcing immutability on update.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Listings include the `sellerId` to avoid `get()` calls for ownership checks.
 * - Chats include a `participants` array for efficient access control.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User data is segregated under `/users/{userId}` for privacy.
