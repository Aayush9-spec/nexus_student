/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the student marketplace application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes secure data access based on user roles, ownership, and explicit membership.
 * It leverages denormalization to avoid costly `get()` calls and ensure efficient authorization.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Stores user profiles. Access is restricted to the owner.
 * - `/listings/{listingId}`: Stores marketplace listings. Access is based on ownership (`sellerId`).
 * - `/chats/{chatId}`: Stores chat metadata with a `participants` array for authorized access.
 * - `/chats/{chatId}/messages/{messageId}`: Stores messages within a chat, inheriting chat-level authorization.
 * - `/reviews/{reviewId}`: Stores reviews, accessible to anyone but creation is limited to buyers reviewing sellers.
 * - `/events/{eventId}`: Stores event information, accessible to anyone but updates only by the organizer.
 * - `/community_feed/{postId}`: Stores community feed posts, accessible to anyone but updates only by the author.
 * - `/reports/{reportId}`: Stores reports, accessible to admins.
 * - `/transactions/{transactionId}`: Stores transaction data, accessible to involved users (buyer/seller).
 * - `/roles_admin/{userId}`: Stores admin role assignments.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed for privacy.
 * - Public read access is granted to listings, events, and community feed for discoverability.
 * - All write operations are strictly controlled based on ownership, membership, or role.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Listings include `sellerId` to allow ownership checks without extra reads.
 * - Chats include a `participants` array for direct membership-based authorization.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User data and admin roles are stored in separate collections for clarity and security.
