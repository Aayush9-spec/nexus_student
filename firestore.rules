/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the student marketplace application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a combination of user-ownership, shared access, and public-read/owner-write patterns to protect data.
 * It prioritizes authorization independence via denormalization to avoid costly `get()` calls.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}`, ensuring only the user can manage their own profile.
 * - Listings are stored under `/listings/{listingId}` and are publicly readable, but only the seller can modify them.
 * - Chats are stored under `/chats/{chatId}` with subcollections of messages, accessible only to participants.
 * - Reviews, Events, Community Feed Posts, Reports, and Transactions are top-level collections with owner-based or role-based restrictions.
 * - Admin roles are stored under the `/roles_admin/{userId}` collection. The existence of the document is what confers privileges.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is implicitly denied by the absence of a specific rule allowing it.
 * - Public read access is granted to listings and community feed, with ownership checks for modification.
 * - All write operations are strictly controlled via authorization checks.
 * - Data validation is limited to authorization-critical fields for rapid prototyping.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Listings include `sellerId` to enable ownership checks without additional reads.
 * - Chats include a `participants` array to authorize access to chat messages.
 * - Community Feed posts include an `authorId` to enable ownership checks for modifications.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User profiles and admin roles are stored in separate collections to clearly differentiate user data from administrative data.
