/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the student marketplace application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes strict user-ownership and shared-access models,
 * leveraging denormalization to avoid costly `get()` calls and to ensure
 * secure list operations. Administrative privileges are managed through a dedicated
 * `roles_admin` collection.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. Access is restricted to the
 *   owner (the user themselves).
 * - /listings/{listingId}: Stores marketplace listings. Uses an `sellerId` field
 *   for owner-based authorization.
 * - /chats/{chatId}: Stores chat metadata, including a `participants` array
 *   for authorized access.
 * - /chats/{chatId}/messages/{messageId}: Stores individual messages within a chat,
 *   access is controlled by the parent chat's participants.
 * - /reviews/{reviewId}: Stores reviews for sellers, linked by `sellerId` and `buyerId`
 *   for authorization.
 * - /events/{eventId}: Stores event data, linked by `organizerId` for ownership checks.
 * - /community_feed/{postId}: Stores community feed posts, linked by `authorId`.
 * - /reports/{reportId}: Stores reports of users or content.
 * - /transactions/{transactionId}: Stores transaction data, linked by `buyerId`, `sellerId`, and `listingId`.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Used to store admin user ids.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is generally disallowed unless specifically intended for public
 *   collections.
 * - Strict ownership is enforced for user-related data through the `isOwner()`
 *   helper function.
 * - Shared access for chats is managed through the `participants` array.
 * - Admin privileges are determined by the existence of a document in the
 *   `roles_admin` collection.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Listings store the `sellerId` to allow ownership checks without extra reads.
 * - Chats store the `participants` array to enable membership-based access control.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User data is stored under `/users/{userId}` for private access.
 * - Community feed posts and listings are stored in top-level collections for public access.
