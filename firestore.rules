/**
 * @file Nexus Student Marketplace - Firestore Security Rules
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and allows public read access to listings while restricting write access to the owner. Transactions, reviews, and messages are publicly accessible.
 * @data_structure
 *  - `/users/{userId}`: Stores user profiles.  Access is restricted to the user themselves.
 *  - `/listings/{listingId}`: Stores marketplace listings. Public read, owner-only write.
 *  - `/transactions/{transactionId}`: Stores transaction data.
 *  - `/reviews/{reviewId}`: Stores reviews data.
 *  - `/messages/{messageId}`: Stores messages data.
 * @key_security_decisions
 *  - User listing is disallowed.
 *  - Public read access is granted for listings.
 *  - Owner-only write access is enforced for listings.
 * @denormalization_for_authorization
 *  - Listings store the `sellerId` to avoid needing to read the UserProfile for authorization.
